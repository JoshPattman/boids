 - Binaries available in the `bin/` folder
 - Once run, press ESC to exit
 - WASD to move view, QE to zoom
 - Use argument -n to specify the number of Boids
 - It will lag briefly at the beginning when there are loads of Boids really close to each other, but will speed up shortly after the Boids spread out
